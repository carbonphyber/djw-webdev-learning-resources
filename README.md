Technologies and Languages
--------------------------

This repo will contain learning resources for languages and technologies I personally use.  I have traditionally used a LAMP (Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP).

As such, there are a lot of languages and technologies that exist in the world that will not be covered in this repo. QQ moar.

Repo Organization
-----------------

Resources are organized by their place on the technology stack.

Front-end technologies will be located in the `/web_client/` directory:

 * HTML,
 * CSS,
 * CSS pre-processors (LESS / SASS / SCSS),
 * JavaScript
 * JavaScript pre-processors (CoffeeScript)

Server-side technologies will be located in the `/web_server/` directory:

 * Web server software (Apache, NGinX, etc.)
 * PHP (interpreted language -- both dynamic web language and CLI)
 * Perl
 * RDBMS (Postgres, MySQL, and SQLite)

Linux (and UNIX and FreeBSD and Solaris, and ...) learning resources will be located in the `/linux/` directory:

 * Common commands
 * Navigational tokens
 * BASH

I have not yet decided on locations for larger concepts:

 * HTTP
 * Sessions and Cookies
 * SSL
